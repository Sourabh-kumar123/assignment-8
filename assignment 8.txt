ANSWER 1:-
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
addition_result = num1 + num2
subtraction_result = num1 - num2
division_result = num1 / num2
multiplication_result = num1 * num2
print("Addition: ", addition_result)
print("Subtraction: ", subtraction_result)
print("Division: ", division_result)
print("Multiplication: ", multiplication_result)

ANSWER 2:-
i) "/" ->it is division operator which return quotient in decimal as well as integer form.
and "//" it is floor division which return quotient in int data type.
ii)'**" it is the sign of power
and "^" this is bitwise xor operator which return 1 when both variable are same.


ANSWER 3:-
logical operator 
AND OR NOT
AND - both condition need to be true
OR  - one condtion need to be true
NOT - it is vice versa means do oppopite .it will make false which is true.

ANSWER 4:-

num = 10  
result = num >> 2 
print(result)

um = 5 
result = num << 2 
print(result)  
the right shift operator (>>) moves the bits towards the right, effectively
 dividing the number by 2 for each shift. On the other hand,
 the left shift operator (<<) moves the bits towards the left, effectively
 multiplying the number by 2 for each shift.


ANSWER 5:
lst = [2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 38]
if 10 in lst:
    print("10 is present in the list.")
else:
    print("10 is not present in the list.")
